Youth Dance Weekend Location Data
---------------------------------

This repository contains code and results for analyzing the location data of YDW
attendees over time. To run `rebuild.py` yourself, you must have the following
installed:

* Python 3.x+
* [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [SciPy](http://scipy.org/)

Installing these can take some time. Python requirements are listed explicitly
(in a pip-readable format) in `requirements.txt`.
